# Fable Hub

**Fable Hub** is a community-driven umbrella organization for F# → JavaScript ecosystem projects.
Its purpose is to provide a stable, neutral home for libraries, tools, and experiments that support the Fable compiler.

## Purpose

* Keep useful community projects accessible even if original maintainers become unavailable.
* Provide a shared namespace and clear point of contact for long-term maintenance.
* Encourage collaboration.

## How It Works

* Projects may be transferred into the organization or started here directly.
* Maintainers retain rights over their work.
* Add [FableHub](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/FableHub) as NuGet owner.
* Inactive projects remain available for reference and potential revival.

## Get Involved

Contributions and new maintainers are welcome.
Open an issue in any repository or contact the maintainers through GitHub discussions.
